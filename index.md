### Q2 Proposal Question

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic for me this quarter has been using genetics to predict polygenic risk scores (PRS). This process is incredibly meaningful, as I can leverage GWAS data to calculate PRS and understand where an individual stands in the genetic distribution. The ability to derive valuable insights from genetic data gives me a strong sense of accomplishment.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For my Quarter 2 project, I am interested in exploring individual prediction within the field of biostats. Specifically, I would like to investigate the genetic risk of ankylosing spondylitis. This direction will not only deepen my understanding of genetic risk assessment but also allow me to apply PRS techniques in the context of a specific disease.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project？**

In my current research, I am using cis-eQTL analysis to determine the PRS for height. A potential improvement would be to incorporate machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. This approach could add value to my predictive model and could be applied to future studies.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In future projects, I am interested in utilizing deep learning, as it could optimize our prediction outcomes. By incorporating deep learning, the model might capture more complex relationships between genes and phenotypes, thus enhancing the reliability and precision of predictions.
